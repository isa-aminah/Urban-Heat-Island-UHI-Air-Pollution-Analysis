# Urban-Heat-Island-UHI-Air-Pollution-Analysis
This project investigates the relationship between urban heat island effects and air pollution levels in major cities. Using environmental datasets (air quality indicators like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃), the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to: Quantify temperature differences between urban and rural areas, Explore correlations between UHI intensity and pollution levels, Assess the role of green cover and meteorological factors in mitigating UHI and pollution.
The project supports green skills by emphasizing sustainable urban planning, environmental monitoring, and pollution control.
